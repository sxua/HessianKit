HessianKit also provide functionality to automatically generate classes\r\nfor published value objects. Both web service proxies and value objects are \r\ndefined as basic Objective-C Protocols.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get HessianKit installed is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/).\r\nJust add this line to your `Podfile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npod \"HessianKit\", \"~> 2.0.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found at [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/HessianKit/2.0.0).\r\nAlso it can be generated using an [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) or a native utility [headerdoc2html](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/headerdoc2html.1.html).\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n\r\nThe HessianKit project consist of several targets:\r\n\r\n* __Documentation__ generates headerdoc documentation for the OS X and iOS APIs.\r\n* __HessianKit__ generates a framework to be bundled with applications for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, includes documentation.\r\n* __StaticHessianKit__ generates a static library to be linked with applications for iOS 4.0 and later.\r\n* __MacTests__ executes unit tests for HessianKit target against Mac OS X 10.5 and later.\r\n* __iPhoneTests__ executes unit tests for StaticHessianKit against iOS 4.0 and later.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright 2008-2009 Fredrik Olsson, Cocoway.
